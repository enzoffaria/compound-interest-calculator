This is my first hands-on project using javascript and programming logic. I did it completely from scratch without the support of any material other than the series "JavaScript - Curso em VÃ­deo (youtube)" I am satisfied with the result but I know that I need to urgently improve the structure of my code.

I started reading Clean Code and I'm studying JS deeper
