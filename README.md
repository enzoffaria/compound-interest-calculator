# compound-interest-calculator
This is my first practical project using javascript and programming logic.  I did it completely from scratch without the support of any material other than the series "JavaScript - Curso em VÃ­deo (youtube)"  I'm satisfied with the result but I know that I need to improve the structure of my code urgently.
